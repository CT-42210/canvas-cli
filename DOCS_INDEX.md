## Key Architectural Patterns

### The Three-Layer Architecture
- **Commands Layer** (`src/commands/`) - Orchestration
- **UI/Display Layer** (`src/ui/`) - User interaction and formatting
- **Data Layer** (`src/api/` + `src/utils/`) - API calls and data transformation

### The Standard Command Flow
1. Authenticate → 2. Load/Fetch → 3. Select/Filter → 4. Transform → 5. Display → 6. Error Handling

### The Color System
Canvas Custom Colors → In-Memory Cache → Hash-Based Fallback

### The Error Philosophy
NEVER TRUNCATE ERRORS - Always show complete messages with stack traces.

### The Text Icon System
- `[*]` = Info (cyan)
- `[+]` = Success (green)
- `[!]` = Warning (yellow)
- `[X]` = Error (red)
- `[>]` = Navigation (default)

---

## Important Notes for Development

1. **Always require authentication** at the start of commands
2. **Use date-based filtering** - Don't trust `has_submitted_submissions`
3. **Cache colors in memory** - Use getCourseColor() consistently
4. **Use text icons only** - No emoji symbols
5. **Use 24-hour time format** - Set `hour12: false`
6. **Check for null selections** - User might cancel Inquirer prompts
7. **Wrap in try/catch** - Always call displayError() on errors
8. **Show full errors** - Never truncate or abbreviate error messages

2. Check QUICK_REFERENCE.md for relevant code snippet
3. Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed implementation
4. Look at similar existing code for patterns
