CANVAS CLI OUTLINE

This application is a CLI interface for Canvas LMS (by Instructure). Works with any university or school that uses Canvas.

Design a CLI tool with these specifications:

"canvas" is the base command added to path

The select functionality should replicate Firebases select functionality, which uses the arrow keys to sort up and down and the space bar/enter key to confirm the currently selected item. this will be used to sort between assignments, classes, any sort of navigation

The display functionality should mimic a popup, but through a CLI. Once desplaying the desired information, the program should give a list of action items, listed with numbers to execute. the user can either press enter with no number to return to the terminal, or press a number corresponding to those actions to execute them. some examples of actions could be to open the current item on canvas in a web browser, to submit an assignment with a file, etc. 

the general feel of this CLI app should be modern. use the colors for each class from canvas for accents.

canvas raw [any command] - returns raw unformatted data from the API

DIRECTIONS FOR DEVELOPING THIS APP:

- NEVER truncate errors. if there are errors, display the entire message. EVERY TIME. NO EXCEPTIONS.
- When fleshing out the API calls, do not assume that you understand the message format. Double check, either by referencing the docs of the canvas API or by designing test cases to see the format. as it will be returned
